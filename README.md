# All About That Text

### Introduction

We'll be making an app that's all about that text. We've been making event listener functions that take in input in two ways: what was clicked, and what's the current state of our app. For this project. the focus will be looking at what was clicked, _and_ what was typed into our input box.

Because we're all about that text, 'bout that text, no pictures.

Sorry about getting that stuck in your head!


### Tools We'll Learn, Practice, And Begin To Master

* Event listener functions.
* Reading strings from input boxes.
* String building and manipulation.
* Keeping our back end and front end separate.
* Function expressions.
* Creating, appending, and removing elements.
